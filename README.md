# Showroom

Hi and welcome, my name is César Martínez and I'm a data scientist becoming web developer interested in using backend and frontend frameworks to build web applications integrated with data science functionalities. 

This is a readme-only repo intended as a showroom for my development projects. I'll be specificating which languages and frameworks were used for each one. Each project element will include a brief description and a link to its source code repository. 

My projects cover applications in domain areas I find interesting such as productivity enhancement and financial administration. I'm also a game-developer but that showroom repository is not yet built. 

Hope you may find my projects useful and interesting for your own use.
If you have any questions feel free to contact me at [cemar.ortiz@gmail.com](cemar.ortiz@gmail.com)
