# Showroom

Hi and welcome, my name is César Martínez and I'm a data scientist becoming web developer interested in using backend and frontend frameworks to build web applications integrated with data science functionalities. 

This is a readme-only repo intended as a showroom for my development projects. I'll be specificating which languages and frameworks were used for each one. Each project element will include a brief description and a link to its source code repository.

Hope you may find my projects useful and interesting for your own use.
If you have any questions feel free to contact me at [cemar.ortiz@gmail.com](cemar.ortiz@gmail.com)
