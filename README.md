# Showroom

Hi and welcome, my name is César Martínez and I'm a python developer building digital solutions in the form of applications and data science projects.

This is a **readme-only** repo intended as a portfolio for my development projects. I'll be specificating which languages and frameworks were used for each one. Each project element will include a brief description and a link to its source code repository. 

My projects cover applications in domain areas I find interesting such as productivity enhancement and financial administration. I also do Kaggle challenges to stay sharp on my data skills and I'm a hobbyist game-developer so I will be uploading some of those projects here too. 

### Links to projects:

- **[Money Dog](https://github.com/cemar-ortiz/money_dog)**: Money Dog is a personal, semi-automated assistant that helps you keep track of your personal finances. This project is still on development and I will be updating it with new features!. _Language: Python, frameworks: pandas_

- **[Hangman game - CLI based](https://github.com/cemar-ortiz/hangman_cli)**: The classic programming challenge to polish your OOP skills and your standard library knowledge. I maintain this game development project as a hobby and I'm very proud of what I have learned with it, so I thought: why not share it publicly? Maybe it could be educational for someone else besides me. I'll be uploading it with new features until I become busy or entertained with other projects._Language: Python_

### Other links:

- **[Coding challenges](https://github.com/cemar-ortiz/coding_challenges)**: I'm participating in a coding community focused on practicing our algorithms and data structure skills, we code in whatever language we are most comfortable and feedback each other, it's fun. I will be uploading my implementations for such challenges here. Hope you may find them useful if you're learning about this too!._Language: Python_

- **Data structures**: On July 2021 I found on a street market a 1980's book written by John L. Pfaltz on Computer Data Structures. All exercises in the book were written in Fortran so I thought: why not parse these exercises to Python? It could be a nice challenge and could end up being educational not only for me, but for others too. I will be uploading in this repo these exercises. _Language: Python_ 

Hope you may find my projects useful and interesting for your own use.
