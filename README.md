# Showroom

Hi and welcome, my name is César Martínez and I'm a python developer using backend and frontend frameworks to build applications integrated with data science functionalities. 

This is a **readme-only** repo intended as a showroom portfolio for my development projects. I'll be specificating which languages and frameworks were used for each one. Each project element will include a brief description and a link to its source code repository. 

My projects cover applications in domain areas I find interesting such as productivity enhancement and financial administration. I'm also a hobbyist game-developer so I will be uploading some of those projects here too. 

### Links to projects:

- **MoneyDog**: Money Dog is a personal, semi-automated assistant that helps you keep track of your personal finances. This project is still on development and I will be updating it with new features!._Coded with Python_

### Other links:

- **Coding challenges**: I'm participating in a coding community focused on practicing our algorithms and data structure skills, we code in whatever language we are most comfortable and feedback each other, it's fun. I will be uploading my implementations for such challenges here. Hope you may find them useful if you're learning about this too!.

Hope you may find my projects useful and interesting for your own use.
